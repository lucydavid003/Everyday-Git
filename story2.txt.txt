My School Life
School became my second home. 
From my early days in primary school to university, 
I loved learning and growing. I faced challenges—like lack of resources
 and self-doubt—but I pushed through. I discovered talents in writing,
 leadership, and creativity. Friends and teachers shaped my confidence.
 Every test and group project taught me lessons beyond books.
 My school life laid the foundation for the dreamer and doer I am 
becoming today.
