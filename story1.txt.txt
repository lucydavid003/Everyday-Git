My Background
I was born and raised in a humble home where values like respect,
 hard work, and faith were deeply rooted. Life was not always easy,
 but my family gave me strength and love. Growing up, I learned to
 find joy in the little things. My background taught me resilience,
 and Iâ€™ve always carried the hope that my story could inspire someone else,
 no matter how small their beginnings.
